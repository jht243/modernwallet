description: AUTONOMOUS trending-tool catcher. Finds tool names breaking out right now (named in ≥3 independent stories in 72h) and hands them to /mindmap-pass as a brief. NO human gates.

<!-- fleet-evidence-contract-v2 -->
**Shared evidence and takeaway rules:** Read the active project's `.claude/commands/_decision-evidence.md` and `_testing-labels.md` before planning, writing, enriching, auditing or publishing substantive content. These contracts govern original analysis, honest visible attribution, intent-based takeaways and tested-label decisions, including work handed to mindmap by another routine. Apply them inside the existing Phase 3 / independent Phase 4 process; no separate workflow or extra human gate. Preserve site permissions, medical/psychedelic and all other exclusions, required professional review, existing sufficient verdicts and the no-addition branch. Local eligibility or an old TESTED template never proves a test happened. If this is a global routine, resolve its sibling shared contracts and install them in the active project before use while preserving local rules. These requirements supersede older blanket testing licenses, copied methods and automatic year/label instructions.

<!-- workflow-source-freshness-v1 -->
**WORKFLOW SOURCE FRESHNESS — required before every routine.** Before reading routine instructions, editing files or publishing, run `bash .claude/tools/workflow-start.sh` from each active repository. In cloud runs use `bash .claude/tools/workflow-start.sh --cloud`. Local isolated checkouts must include current uncommitted/unpushed source instructions, code, configuration and dependencies; cloud checkouts must match the live published default branch, not a cached remote reference. Cloud cannot see unpublished laptop files: ship reviewed workflow changes before expecting cloud to use them. Missing helpers, failed verification or stale inputs block the affected repository; resolve/integrate the listed dependencies while preserving unrelated work, then recheck. Never bulk-copy dirty files, bypass the check, invent a passing receipt or publish inherited changes without their required review. The check permits this run's own edits after a verified start. Preserve all existing scope, exclusions, schedules, approvals and publication rules. Non-repository tasks have no checkout to check. No new human approval gate.
Run startup as a standalone command and inspect its actual exit code; never pipe it through head/tail/tee or continue after failure.
Startup returns a fresh `runId` after verification; pass it via `--run-id` to this run's later startup checks and every `workflow-preflight.py prepare`. Never reuse an old run ID for a new routine, including in the same chat. A runner may instead supply a fresh per-invocation `WORKFLOW_RUN_ID` consistently.

# /hype-radar-auto — breakout AI tools → /mindmap-pass

<!-- workflow-checkpoints-v1 -->
**Complete instructions and rule application:** Before substantive content planning, writing, audit or publication, follow `.claude/commands/_workflow-checkpoints.md`. Use `.claude/tools/workflow-preflight.py` to deliver the current phase and required contracts in complete bounded chunks, then pass its completeness/freshness check. The existing chart reviewer and independent Phase 4 reviewer must audit application with artifact evidence, including source provenance, local exclusions, visible attribution, intent-based takeaways and consistent tested labels. Follow the sibling `_rendered-page-audit.md`: finish central source research before the preparation PASS; audit the complete rendered pages after all template/affiliate/link changes, block inherited contradictions affecting the answer, and verify exact reviewed output live with `rendered-audit.py` before closing deployment and measurement records. Install that contract and helper with the checkpoint dependencies. A read-only reviewer may write internal evidence receipts without editing content. Delivery receipts are not proof of understanding or an audit PASS. Keep existing phases and the sole Phase 0 human gate. Global routines resolve/install the sibling shared checkpoint contract and helper into the active project while preserving local rules.

> **‼️ AUTONOMOUS.** No human checkpoint. Never print "Approve?". Nothing new → exit 0 silently.

## STEP 1 — Harvest
```bash
python3 scripts/hype_radar/pull.py pull --json reports/hype-radar/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).json
```
Scans Hacker News, Google Trends daily RSS and Reddit; keeps a name only when it appears in ≥3 distinct stories; skips names already in the ledger; records every survivor to the ledger.

`candidates: []` → exit 0. Done.

## STEP 2 — Send them all
Every candidate goes into the brief as returned. No filtering, no judging, no volume gate — a brand-new tool has no volume yet; that is the point.

Brief = one line per candidate: name, story count, sources, `search_caught_up`, and the evidence titles verbatim.

## STEP 3 — Run /mindmap-pass with that brief
```
/mindmap-pass <the brief>
```
Force-create (zero volume never vetoes a row). Mindmap does everything from here — research, dedup, writing, audit, build, commit, push, 200-verify, IndexNow, report. Nothing after it.
